# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** practice and implementations in **Python and C++**. It showcases the solutions I wrote while learning and improving on core CS topics during my DSA journey. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

I have covered a wide range of topics including  
✔ Arrays  
✔ Strings  
✔ Linked Lists (with pointers)  
✔ Stack  
✔ Queue  
✔ Trees  
✔ Graphs  
✔ Python code implementations  
✔ STL usage in C++  
✔ Various algorithms and problem-solving approaches

Through this repo you will find well-structured solutions to common DSA problems, aimed at strengthening fundamentals and preparing for interviews.
